        <p><img alt= "NITW In Game Art" src= "images/nitw.jpg"/></p>
        <p>As fall is upon us, it's the perfect time to cozy up with a video game that captures the essence of fall. Night in the Woods, an indie gem developed by Infinite Fall, immerses the player in the mystery of season. Its charming 2D style complements the fall atmosphere with a warm color palette. Alongside the artstyle, the game's fantastic soundtrack enhances the game's overall experience. Night in the Woods takes place in the town of Possom Springs, following the main character Mae as she returns to her home town after dropping out of college, reconnecting with her parents and friends. Characters in the game are relatable, allowing players' to identify with them and feel more connected to the game. The game's main theme surrounds change, reflection, nostalgia, and self-discovery. As fall is a season for change, with leaves changing colors and falling, I think the season pairs incredibly with the themes of changing within the game. Not to forget, there is a mystery element added to the game's plot, capturing the vibe of Halloween.
        Overall, Night in the Woods is a must-play video game for the fall season. Its captivating autumn atmosphere, soundtrack, and themes make it an excellent choice to embrace the beauty of the season. </p>
