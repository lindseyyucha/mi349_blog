    <p>Hey, I'm Lindsey Yucha! I major in Games and Interactive Media with a focus on Game Development at Michigan State University. Video games have been my passion since I was a kid, and I'm thrilled to be part of this major, where I can dive deeper into the world of game creation and design.
    My journey into the realm of tech and gaming doesn't stop in the classroom. Since the fall of 2021, I've been working at the Michigan State University Tech Store, where I've been helping individuals with their tech needs. Additionally, I've had the incredible opportunity to explore a different facet of storytelling and technology as a journalist intern at the Detroit Metro Times.
    Whether I'm crafting virtual adventures, assisting people with their tech dilemmas, or uncovering captivating stories in the heart of Detroit, I'm always up for an exciting challenge. I'm genuinely enthusiastic about game development, and I'd love to connect with fellow enthusiasts to share our passion for games and all things tech!</p>
